TODO:
* Make a decoders 
* Make instructions run in order with an indicator of what instruction is selected
* Make Instructions work with add and subtract and basic instructions
* Make the current instructions print to the output section in binary or hex
* Memory make it work?
* Need to make rules checking for regitsers with register values
* Clean up 
* Test, debug, pre-release
* UDN Document
* Optimisations
* Optimisations for textures as they are still firework PNG
* Get rid or empty the tags variable

BUGS? WHAT SQUASH THEM, MAYBE LATER...:
