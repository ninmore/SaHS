Project SaHS Notes:

NOTES:

NO INTERACTIVE INTERFACE UNTIL EVERYTHING ELSE IS DONE!

Instruction ID's = Tag 0
* 1 = Start
* 2 = End
* 3 = Move
* 4 = Call

Type of connector = Tag 1

* 1 = Bottom Connector
* 2 = Top Connector
* 3 = Both Top and Bottom Connector (The cheater)
* 4 = Both Top and Bottom and Right Connector
* 5 = Left Connector
* 6 = Left Connector with also Right Connector



TODO:
* Delete Instruction
* Move Instructions/ Up or Down
* Registers! 
* Make a decoders 
* Make instructions run in order with an indicator of what instruction is selected
* Make registers work by adding a removing them from an array
* Make Instructions work with arrays
* Make Instructions work with add and subtract and basic instructions
* Make the current instructions print to the output section in binary or hex
* Memory make it work?
* Clean up 
* Test, debug, pre-release
* UDN Document
* Optimisations
* Optimisations for textures as they are still firework PNG
* Get rid or empty the tags variable

BUGS? WHAT SQUASH THEM, MAYBE LATER...:
* Shadowy thing under art?

PSEUDO CODE!

Is there any other instruction on in the area?
	if(true): 
		Return CAN-DELETE=FALSE; MOVE-UP=FALSE; MOVE-DOWN=FALSE;
	else:
		Can the instruction above swap places?
		if(true)
			Can the instruction below swap places?
			if(true)
				Return CAN-DELETE=TRUE; MOVE-UP=TRUE; MOVE-DOWN=TRUE;
			else 
				Return CAN-DELETE=TRUE; MOVE-UP=TRUE; MOVE-DOWN=FALSE;
		else:
			if(true)
				Return CAN-DELETE=TRUE; MOVE-UP=FALSE; MOVE-DOWN=TRUE;
			else 
				Return CAN-DELETE=TRUE; MOVE-UP=FALSE; MOVE-DOWN=FALSE;
