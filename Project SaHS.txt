* Numerial Value
* Register
* Register Indirect
* Memory
* Indirect Memory
* Label

InsertType:
* 0 = None
* 1 = Above
* 2 = Below
* 3 = All

TODO:
* Convert Macros to Instructions, they look better
* Labels
* CPU Menu
* Make attributes change colour depending on the value type
* Add tool tips to instructions
* Add float support
* Clicking on the flag flips the flag.
* Need to add overflow checks!
* Make instructions run in order with an indicator of what instruction is selected
* Make Instructions work with add and subtract and basic instructions
* Make the current instructions print to the output section in binary or hex
* Memory make it work?
* Need to make rules checking for regitsers with register values
* Clean up 
* Test, debug, pre-release
* UDN Document
* Optimisations
* Optimisations for textures as they are still firework PNG
* Get rid or empty the tags variable

BUGS? WHAT SQUASH THEM, MAYBE LATER...:
* Shadowy thing under art?
