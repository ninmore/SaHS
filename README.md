# SaHS - Systems Architecture for High Schoolers
This project was made for my final year project and was made in the Unreal Engine, using their Epic Games software. Feature and usage of the software can be found in the documentation PDF.

The software is used to show the basics of CPU simulation and Computer Systems Architecture (CSA).

Any issues found please make sure you are able to replicate the issue so it can be found and fixed faster.
